# Simple-image-comparison
This project was made to create a very simple way to compare images and find duplicates while allowing for an adjustable amount of difference between images.
It is based on my 2012 project which was published in an article at The Code Project : https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/374386/Simple-image-comparison-in-NET - but has been simplified, parallized and converted to .NET Core.
